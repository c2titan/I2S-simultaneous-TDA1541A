# I2S-simultaneous-TDA1541A
VHDL code for converting standard I2S data (64fs) to the offset-binary data (simultaneous) needed for TDA1541A DAC

- "I2S 2x32=64-bit = 64fs" to "16-bit offset-binary" (simultaneous) with inverted MSB and stop-clocked BCK) for TDA1541A DAC (stereo) without the use of MCLK (= even less digital work)
- basic data synchronisation is incorporated on LRCK signal
- the sound is nice, clean, without digital interference
- my VHDL code is very simple, without advanced techniques, based mostly on standard logic
- therefore inexperienced users can understand and modify it for other similar DACs
- it has low load on the CPLD and it takes up little memory
- only 3 signal wires (I2S) are needed for input (DATA, BCK, LRCK).
- output is true offset-binary specified for TDA1541A in the simultaneous mode: 
- - CL (outBCK) - stopped DAC clock 
- - DL (outDL) - Left DAC data (inversed MSB) 
- - DR (outDR) - Right DAC data (inversed MSB) 
- - LE (outLE) - Latch for both channels (latched together)
- it flawlessly works with the cheap CPLD EPM240T100C5 from aliexpress and can be easily configured for others
- my VHDL code is open and free for all
